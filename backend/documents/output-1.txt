RELATED LITERATURE 
 
Web-Archives 
Web archives enable users to access and study past versions of websites, 
helping to document the evolution of the web and providing valuable resources 
for researchers, historians, and anyone interested in understanding the 
development of online content and digital culture over time. highlighting the 
challenges it presents to researchers while also emphasizing the diverse 
opportunities it offers for interpretation. Brügger goes on to discuss how 
historians can adapt traditional research methods to effectively study the archived 
web, with a focus on aspects such as establishing the origin of web content, 
creating comprehensive overviews of archived materials, evaluating different 
versions, and appropriately citing digital sources. In essence, this chapter sets the 
stage for the development of a methodology to conduct web history in the digital 
age, providing valuable guidance to both contemporary media scholars and future 
historians. (Brügger N 2018) 
A web archive, often referred to as a web archive or web collection, is a 
digital repository or database that systematically captures and stores snapshots of 
web pages and websites as they appear at different points in time. 
The data archive system described in the paper offers the advantage of 
automatically determining the storage destination for archiving, reducing the 
manual work involved in the process. By utilizing control information and an 
archive rule table, the system efficiently decides whether to archive data to the 
on-premise environment or the cloud storage.

Web archiving has been in existence for decades now, dating back to the 
1990s and the establishment of the Internet Archive. In the late 1990s a variety of 
nonprofits and universities began to archive various aspects of digital content, but 
the formation of the Internet Archive in 1996 launched the first comprehensive 
Web archiving program in the world (Toyoda & Kitsuregawa, 2012). 
Early Web archiving was sporadic in nature, as collections were often built 
from donated datasets or were constructed in an adhoc nature by sampling across 
web domains. In the subsequent decades the degree of Web archiving has 
accelerated and become far more comprehensive (Milligan, 2016; Schneider et 
al., 2003). 
Web archives serve as invaluable time capsules, granting users access to 
historical iterations of websites. This access not only documents the web's 
evolution but also provides researchers, historians, and enthusiasts with rich 
resources. 
 A fundamental aspect of digital preservation, is indispensable in 
safeguarding the vast and dynamic digital landscape. In an era characterized by 
unprecedented internet usage, preserving web content has become a pressing 
concern to maintain our cultural, historical, and scholarly heritage. Libraries, 
archives, and cultural heritage institutions have become acutely aware of the 
pivotal role played by web archiving in ensuring that the wealth of information 
disseminated online is not lost to the passage of time (Besser, 2001).  
11

The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, initiated by Kahle (1996), stands 
as a testament to the power of web archiving, allowing users to access historical 
snapshots of websites dating back to the early days of the internet. Such initiatives 
highlight the collaborative nature of web archiving, where institutions pool 
resources to preserve the ever-expanding digital corpus (Koerbin & Ross, 2017). 
 
Plagiarism 
Plagiarism involves the unauthorized use of someone else's work without 
providing proper credit to the original creator, thereby diminishing the originality 
and authenticity of the content. It encompasses all types of creative works, 
whether published or unpublished, such as manuscripts, printed materials, and 
digital formats. Plagiarism can be intentional, careless, or accidental. Deliberate 
or negligent acts of plagiarism are strictly prohibited according to examination 
regulations, and disciplinary actions may be taken as a consequence. Plagiarism 
is morally wrong because it involves falsely claiming ownership of another 
person's work, essentially constituting theft. Furthermore, it violates the principles 
of academic integrity, which teach students how to responsibly share information 
and acknowledge the contributions of creators. Therefore, plagiarism is in direct 
violation of these principles. Plagiarism not only has ethical implications but also 
diminishes the value of college degrees. If companies perceive that a significant 
number of students have engaged in cheating to obtain their degrees, it 
undermines the credibility and reputation of those degrees. While academic 
plagiarism may not be illegal, it is a violation of academic honesty policies set by 
12 
 
Web Based Thesis Archiving System with Plagiarism Scanner and AI Detector  
COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES MAIN CAMPUS 
DON HONORIO VENTURA STATE UNIVERSITY 
institutions. Consequently, students who commit plagiarism can face severe 
consequences such as expulsion or academic probation. To address the issue of 
plagiarism, tutors and instructors utilize AI-based plagiarism detection software. 
These programs employ scanning and coding techniques to identify instances of 
plagiarism in students' work. By using such technology, educators can more 
effectively detect and address cases of plagiarism, promoting academic integrity 
and ensuring that students' work is original and properly credited (Zoting, P.G., 
& Dharmadhikari, S.C. 2023).  
Plagiarism is undoubtedly a disgraceful and selfish act as it involves stealing and 
causes harm to others. It often occurs due to reasons such as lack of intelligence, 
creativity, or a lazy attitude towards learning, with individuals seeking shortcuts 
in their research endeavors. Cheating and theft, which plagiarism essentially 
entails, are considered sinful actions. It is crucial to acknowledge and address 
every instance of sin through appropriate rules and sanctions. In the academic 
context, this involves enforcing student and academic regulations, while lecturers 
who commit plagiarism are subject to sanctions based on their ethical code 
(Wijaya, H., & Gruber, K.E. 2018). 
Plagiarism is an increasingly significant problem in the field of academia, with 
the availability of abundant resources and information. Its impact on students' 
performance and the overall quality of education is substantial. To address this 
issue, numerous studies have been conducted to find ways to mitigate plagiarism. 
The process of plagiarism itself is a major concern within academic circles, 
prompting extensive research over several decades. The objective of such 
13 
 
Web Based Thesis Archiving System with Plagiarism Scanner and AI Detector  
COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES MAIN CAMPUS 
DON HONORIO VENTURA STATE UNIVERSITY 
research is to minimize instances of plagiarism, uphold the standards of original 
and creative writing, and safeguard the rights of copyright ownership. Plagiarism 
can be defined as the violation of an author's or authors' copyright, involving the 
unauthorized copying of someone's work or ideas without giving appropriate 
acknowledgment. This act of dishonesty significantly diminishes the quality and 
integrity of the work in question (Jiffriya, M., Jahan, M.A., & Ragel, R.G. 2021).  
Integrity plays a vital role in academic life, as it demonstrates responsible attitudes 
and principles in scientific work. Researchers can prevent plagiarism by gaining 
a proper understanding and taking correct actions. Upholding anti-plagiarism 
measures and ethical values, norms, and rules in higher education aligns with the 
principles of National Education and reflects the transmission of religious values. 
Honesty, integrity, and originality are essential aspects to be carefully considered 
when creating academic work, while plagiarism occurs when individuals fail to 
provide adequate source citation in their work. Ethical values that guide 
researchers in avoiding plagiarism include scientific truth, reasoning, honesty, 
justice, benefit, virtue, responsibility, diversity, and affordability. By adhering to 
these values, individuals can uphold the principles of ethics, maintain the integrity 
of their work, and avoid the detrimental consequences of plagiarism (Wijaya, H., 
& Gruber, K.E. 2018).  
In the study of Khatri and Mohan (2016), a web-based anti-plagiarism approach 
to detect plagiarism at the academic level. The researchers argue that with the 
advancement of technology the rise of plagiarism is alarming. They described that 
plagiarism in academic institutions is putting a negative impact on the academic 
14 
 
Web Based Thesis Archiving System with Plagiarism Scanner and AI Detector  
COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES MAIN CAMPUS 
DON HONORIO VENTURA STATE UNIVERSITY 
integrity of institutions. The researchers' approach to plagiarism detection 
presents a way for online detection of plagiarism and attempts to put an end to the 
cut, copy, and paste culture that is prevalent in academic institutions. Thus, the 
approach's implementation will attempt to promote intellectual growth and 
development among students, as well as help them understand the five essential 
ideals of academic integrity upon which information is generated, shared, and 
assessed. 
These plagiarism detection tools work by comparing sets of documents to identify 
similar passages of text, but this approach has some inherent limitations. Chief 
among these is the single source problem. If a student hires someone to write a 
term paper for them, clearly plagiarism has taken place. However, there is no 
second copy of this paper that can serve as evidence that the work is not the 
student's own. Without this second copy, these plagiarism detection tools are 
unable to differentiate between a plagiarized paper and legitimate work by other 
students. By reframing the task of "preventing plagiarism" into "ensuring 
authorship," a new approach has been developed that is theoretically able to detect 
when single source plagiarism has taken place in programming assignments 
involving source code. Requiring students to provide copies of their code in 
progress, and analyzing changes in subsequent versions can prove when a student 
performed their own work. An implementation of this approach was developed 
and tested on three courses taught by the Department of Computer Science at the 
Florida Institute of Technology. Results of these trials, along with additional 
benefits to the use of such a system are discussed (Koss, Ian Mathias, 2021).

In the study of Nwohori and Ajayi (2021), the authors implemented a system that 
incorporates artificial intelligence through the use of natural language processing 
or NPL. The researcher’s findings show that a document's Similarity index is the 
percentage of text in that document that has been established to exist in other 
documents. Existing plagiarism detectors generate the similarity index; it is then 
up to the instructors to determine if the author properly listed his sources and 
whether the sources linked can safely be used. Using AI, this decision might be 
made by a computer that establishes a "plagiarism index" after analyzing the texts, 
citations, and references. 
Related Studies 
In the study of Mkpojiogu, Akusu, Hussain, Hashim (2020), the authors used 
MySQL, the world's most well-known open-source database management 
technology to implement the system's database to achieve an efficient and time-
saving management for storing, retrieving, and moving of files to solve the 
difficulties and complexities in the manual system of archiving and managing of 
information. The research was primarily designed to handle a long term of storage 
and management of files which are efficient in reducing the use of hardcopy files 
and solving practical problems. 
The development of a web-based thesis archiving system with a plagiarism 
scanner and AI detector addresses the limitations of existing plagiarism detection 
tools. These tools typically compare sets of documents to identify textual 
similarities but face challenges when it comes to the single source problem. In 
situations where a student hires someone to write a term paper, it becomes 
16 
 
Web Based Thesis Archiving System with Plagiarism Scanner and AI Detector  
COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES MAIN CAMPUS 
DON HONORIO VENTURA STATE UNIVERSITY 
difficult to differentiate between plagiarized work and legitimate submissions 
without a second copy of the paper. To overcome this limitation and ensure 
authorship, the proposed web-based system incorporates an innovative approach. 
In addition to archiving theses, it includes a plagiarism scanner and AI detector 
specifically designed for programming assignments involving source code. By 
requiring students to submit copies of their code in progress and analyzing 
subsequent versions, the system can determine if a student has genuinely 
performed their own work. The implementation of this approach has been 
successfully tested on three courses offered by the Department of Computer 
Science at the Florida Institute of Technology. The results of these trials validate 
the effectiveness of the system in detecting single source plagiarism in 
programming assignments. Furthermore, beyond plagiarism detection, the web-
based thesis archiving system offers additional benefits, which can be explored 
and discussed in further detail. By integrating a plagiarism scanner and AI 
detector into a comprehensive web-based thesis archiving system, academic 
institutions can enhance their ability to ensure the authenticity of student work 
and promote academic integrity (Koss, Ian Mathias, 2021).  
Information technology is currently developing rapidly so that every aspect of 
activity cannot be separated from the name technology, of course in the 
administrative aspect it also really requires fast and accurate information 
technology. At the Faculty of Communication and Information Technology, 
National University, currently still using an archive system that has not been 
developed again, which often causes data synchronization. With the E-Archives

application, it is hoped that archiving activities can assist administrative activities 
accurately so that it can become a reference in making the right decisions (Al 
Yarda, R.R., Fitri, I., & Benrahman. 2021). 
 
 
 
 
SYSTEM TECHNICAL BACKGROUND 
 
The thesis management system is built on a web-based architecture using 
various technologies and tools to ensure efficient and reliable functionality. The 
technical background of the system includes: 
 
Front-End Development: The user interface of the system is developed 
using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These 
technologies enable the creation of an intuitive and interactive interface for users 
to submit, search, and access academic documents. 
Back-End Development: The back-end of the system is developed using a 
server-side programming language such as PHP, Python, or Node.js. This allows 
for the implementation of the system's business logic, data processing, and 
integration with the database. 
Database Management: The system utilizes a relational database 
management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle. The 
database is responsible for storing and managing thesis metadata, user 
information, plagiarism scan results, and other relevant data. The chosen RDBMS 
ensures data integrity, security, and efficient retrieval of information. 
18 
 
Web Based Thesis Archiving System with Plagiarism Scanner and AI Detector  
COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES MAIN CAMPUS 
DON HONORIO VENTURA STATE UNIVERSITY 
Document Storage: The system incorporates secure document storage 
mechanisms, which may involve storing academic documents on the server or 
utilizing cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or 
Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. These storage solutions provide scalability, 
accessibility, and data redundancy to ensure the safe preservation of academic 
documents. 
Plagiarism Detection: The system integrates a plagiarism detection tool or 
library to compare submitted theses with a database of previously published 
works. The tool may use techniques such as text similarity analysis, natural 
language processing (NLP), or machine learning algorithms to identify 
plagiarized content accurately.
